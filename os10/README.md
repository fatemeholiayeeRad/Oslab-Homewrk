1-For the first question, we receive the age and if there is a letter from the user.
Then we use the if statement to check if the user is over 18 years old or not.
Now, if the user is under 18 years old, if he has a letter from his parents, he can go to the party But he must return before midnight.
Otherwise, if the user is under 18 years old and does not have a parent letter, he can not go to the party

2-In question 2, to create an empty folder, we must first use the for command
And then inside for we use the mkdir command.

3-Receive a path as a parameter and all files in that path with the extension jpg or png 
In this question we use the for file in $(find $x -type f -name "*.jpg" -or -type f -name "*.png") command.And then inside for we use the mv command to name the files.
